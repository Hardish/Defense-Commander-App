# Defense-Commander-App
*A modern take on an 80’s era video game where the user defends their bases against missile attacks.*

Project Description :


* This app is a game, a modern take on an 80’s era video game where the user defends their bases against missile attacks.
* Major entities in the app include bases, incoming ballistic missiles, and interceptors
* The game increases in difficulty as time passes (i.e., Levels)
* Incoming missiles appear from the top of the screen and head towards the bottom where they will detonate, potentially destroying your bases
* You launch interceptors to destroy the incoming missiles in flight before they hit your bases
* When your bases are gone, the game is over
* Interceptors are launched by a finger-tap
* Sound effects enhance the gaming experience
* A remote database is used to track the top 10 scores among all players
* Scoring in the top 10 allows the user to enter their initials
* Scores are displayed at the end of the game

* Made the scrolling clouds fade in and out over time by slowly varying their “alpha” value. The scrolling clouds alpha value should slowly change from the lowest of 0.25 
(nearly transparent) to the highest of 0.9 (nearly opaque) and then back again from 0.9 down to 0.25 – repeatedly. 
This should continue for the duration of the game.
